# Voice-Activated-LED-Lighting-With-Arduino
It was intended to lighten different LEDs for different sound frequencies with using the sound sensor module.
The sound sensor is simple to use and the aim is to compare the sound frequencies that the sound sensor module perceives with the different numbers which are entered and to open different LEDs accordingly. In addition to that relay is used in the circuit. Relays are switches that open and close circuits electromechanically or electronically. Relays control one electrical circuit by opening and closing contacts in another circuit. Relay is connected to a LED and then to arduino, then another circuit was created and by comparing the sound frequency value from the sound sensor with the value that is given in the code a LED lighting condition was made, but if this condition is not fulfilled, the current to the LED will be cut off by the relay and there will be no lightning seen.
